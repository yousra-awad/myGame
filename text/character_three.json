"YOU: Hi, Alice! I'm looking for a competent, friendly, team oriented intern. Do you have someone to recommend? ALICE: mmm... Yeah! Do you know Yousra? She's currently a senior in Alexandria STEM school, and for her graduation project, she is working on a smart trash classification model using AI and machine learning. Also, she has recently published her own website, Pink Tech! She's worked with programming languages like HTML5, CSS3, and C, too. YOU: Thank you Alice, that was informative. ALICE: No worries. You might want to talk to Isabelle for more details about her technical skills. She's the one working a few desks to my right. You can also download her resume in pdf format on the bottom of this page. YOU: Thanks, take care now! ALICE: Bye bye!"}
