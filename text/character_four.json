"YOU: Hi Isabelle, Alice told me you could tell me more about Yousra's technical skills. ISABELLE: Yeah, sure! From what I know, most of Yousra's programming experience is in HTML, CSS and C. She also knows some Python. She's pretty strong with Robotics as she developed her own line follower robot. She also worked with Android Studio, and developed a mobile application that made her win the first place in Egypt IoT and AI challenge out of 140+ teams. Moreover, she was awarded the best pitch honor because of her outstanding presentation! I'm sure there is a lot more to be said but you can check out some of her work in her resume. There's a link to it on the bottom of this page. YOU: I will definitely take a look later! ISABELLE: You better! YOU: Thanks Isabelle, I appreciate your help. ISABELLE: You're welcome.",
